#### Input Format

```
definitions
%%

%% //user code section can be skipped.
user code
```

#### Definitions 

The definitions section contains declarations of simple name definitions 
to simplify the scanner specification.

Name definitions have the form:

```
name definition
```

#### Rules

(regular expressions, C codes)

The rules section of the flex input contains a series of rules of the form:

```
pattern   action
```

+ default rules

If no match is found, then the default rule is executed: the next character
in the input is considered matched and copied to the standard output.

+ default actions 

If the action is empty, then when the pattern is matched the input token is 
simply discarded.

+ special directives which can be included within an action

    - ECHO
    
    Copies the matched token to the lexer's output.
    
    - TODO: BEGIN
    
    - TODO: REJECT
    
    - An action consisting solely of a vertical bar (‘|’)
    
    Same as the action for the next rule.
    
    - If the action contains a ‘{’, then the action spans till the balancing ‘}’
     is found, and the action may cross multiple lines.

#### Comments

Anything between '/*' and '*/' is considered a comment.
